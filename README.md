# 🔐 RSA Algorithm Implementation (Python)

A simple and educational **Python implementation of the RSA public-key cryptography algorithm**.  
This project demonstrates **RSA key generation, encryption, and decryption** using **basic number theory concepts**.

It is created as a **learning and academic project** to understand how **public-key cryptography** works internally, not as a production-ready security system.

## ✨ Features

### 🔑 RSA Key Generation
- Accepts two prime numbers as input
- Computes modulus (n) and Euler’s Totient (φ)
- Automatically selects a valid public exponent (e)
- Computes private exponent (d) using modular inverse

### 🔒 Encryption
- Encrypts a numeric message using the public key
- Uses efficient modular exponentiation

### 🔓 Decryption
- Decrypts the encrypted message using the private key
- Verifies correctness of the RSA algorithm flow

### 🧮 Educational Focus
- Clear, readable logic
- Minimal dependencies
- Ideal for students and beginners in cryptography

## ⚠️ Limitations

- Uses small prime numbers (not secure)
- No prime number validation
- No padding schemes (e.g., OAEP)
- CLI-based interaction only
- Not suitable for real-world cryptographic use

---

## 🌟 Future Improvements

- Add prime number validation
- Support larger primes
- Implement padding schemes
- Add file encryption support
- Create GUI version
- Improve error handling
