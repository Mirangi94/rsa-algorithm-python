## 📘 About rsa-algorithm-python

This is a simple Python program that shows how RSA encryption works. RSA is a way to keep information safe by turning it into codes that only the right person can read. This program helps you understand how RSA creates keys, locks (encrypts), and unlocks (decrypts) messages.

You don’t need to know programming to use this. The tool runs on your computer and lets you try the RSA steps yourself. It’s meant for learning and safe experimentation.

## 💻 System Requirements

To run rsa-algorithm-python, your computer should meet these requirements:

- Operating system: Windows 10 or newer, macOS 10.13 or newer, or Linux (Ubuntu 18.04 or later recommended)
- Python: Version 3.7 or higher installed on your computer
- Disk space: At least 50 MB free
- RAM: Minimum 2 GB

If you do not have Python installed, this guide will help you get it set up easily.
